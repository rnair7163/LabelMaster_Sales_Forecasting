# LabelMaster_Sales_Forecasting

This was a curricullum project in which we worked on [Labelmaster's](https://www.labelmaster.com) Books and Packaging department. We created a sales forecasting web-app for these departments which would forecast sales for the coming 12 months based on the dates the dataset have. We used SARIMA model for forecasting which performed relatively better with respect to models like SARIMAX, LSTM, etc.
